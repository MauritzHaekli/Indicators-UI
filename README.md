# Indicators UI
This project follwos up on my bachelor thesis to display, configure and backtest trading strategies based on technical indicators. 
By selecting different metrics in a Vue3-based UI, the user is able to display stock data of a selected stock, including entry- and exit-points of a predefined trading strategy.
Additionally several trading statistics are calculated, which determine the success of each trading strategy.

Please note that this project is currently under construction and is not yet ready for sophisticated usage.
